			<span>Footprint Chart</span>
		
		
		
		<p>Footprint Chart helps you to understand the present market conditions from multiple perspectives Price, Volume, Imbalance, Point of Control (POC), Buy&Sell Pressure, but also volume and a dynamic color which signifies more aggressive buying or selling. This is the result of whether more trading occurred on the bid or ask. Footprint Charts provide better understanding because you can see everything in a single bar.</p>

		<span>MARKET PROFILE</span>
		
		
		
		<p>Let’s look at Volume at Price before we explain these important daily price levels. Volume at Price is generally plotted on a chart to view which price levels have attracted high volume trading and which price levels have relatively low volumes. These high and low volume areas often form bell-shaped curves turned on their side, and are commonly referred to as volume profiles.</p>
